Assignment 6: Przelewanka
[Eng. poorly transated to "Pouring" - own. note]

There are n glasses given, numbered 1 through n, with volumes x1, x2, ..., xn
respectively. Initially all the glasses are empty. You are given following
operations:

  - Fill the chosen glass full of tap water,
  - Empty the chosen glass into the sink,
  - Pour water from one glass to another - if it fits, You pour all the water,
    if not, then as much as is needed to fill the second glass.

Your target is a situation in which every glass is filled to a certain level,
y1, y2, ..., yn respectively.

Write a procedure przelewanka: (int * int) array -> int, that takes a given
array of pairs [|(x1, y1); (x2, y2); ...; (xn, yn)|] determines the minimal
number of operations needed to reach the descripted situtation. If reaching
it is impossible, the correct answer is -1.

You can assume that 0 ≤ n and 0 ≤ yi ≤ xi for i = 1, 2, ..., n.
